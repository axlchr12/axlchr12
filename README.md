## About Me
### 👨‍💻 Software Engineer
Currently working with React in a private company based in Jakarta. You can check my monthly commits on my [GitHub account for Work](https://github.com/axelc-una).
### 🇯🇵 Ask me about Japanese<br>
I've been translating Japanese since 2013, which has turned into a hobby. You can explore my translations on [erasatsu](https://erasatsu.com/) or [erasatsu's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EraSatsuIndo) and check out the websites I maintain.
### ⚡ Fun fact
When I'm not coding, I enjoy photography, collecting toys, watching tokusatsu, and translating Japanese content into local subtitles (when i got the mood to do it).
