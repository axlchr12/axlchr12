## About Me
###### 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js after learning Laravel.

###### 💬 Ask me about Japanese things.  Because I've always been translating this since 2013 and it became my hobby.. You can check my translations in <a href="https://askytisubsite.wordpress.com/">askyti </a>and <a href="https://erasatsu.com/">erasatsu</a>. Also, I maintain these two websites.
###### ⚡ Fun fact: Really love photography, translating Japanese things into my local subtitle (when I'm not busy and mood tho).
